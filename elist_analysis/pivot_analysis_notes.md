Growth rates spike upward in 2020 before settling in 2021 and 2022, possibly due to heightened sales during the pandemic. Orders still remained high going into 2021 however, though the AOV was significantly lower.

It's interesting to note that while percentages drop by 13% in January, the overall sales amount still remains relatively high at $730K. Growth rate is not a "one-size fits all" solution for determining monthly value - as also evidened by March containing the third highest growth rate (19%) at only $630K in total sales revenue.
