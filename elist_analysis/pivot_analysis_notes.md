It's interesting to note that while percentages drop by 13% in January, the overall sales amount still remains relatively high at $730K. Growth rate is not a "one-size fits all" solution for determining monthly value - as also evidened by March containing the third highest growth rate (19%) at only $630K in total sales revenue.
